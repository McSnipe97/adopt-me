# react-bench
This ```react-bench``` repository is used for learning reactJS purpose. In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I continue to become a frontend master!  
For this repository:  
- npm install 
- npm install --dev (to use linting, and configured files) 
- npm run lint (to use the configured eslint) 
- npm run dev (for running development mode)
